# Codefellows Ops 201
---

This repository contains the work of my Ops challenges for the Codefellows Ops 201 course. These scripts are primarily for demonstrative purposes and perform basic automation tasks or reference for syntax in Bash and PowerShell for future projects. There are a few extras in here, including a script that knocks out all of Git acp in one go. Feel free to give it a shot if you hate adding, committing and pushing as much as I do. This repository serves as the second chronicle of my progress developing my skills.

## Why learn these skills?

- I am learning these skills to have a better understanding of how cybersecurity works so I can function properly in the industry. I want to develop my skills in hacking, systems administration, and continue to develop my skills beyond that. This industry is constantly changing, and I believe the skills that help me succeed on the water will make me an excellent hacker or analyst. PowerShell and Bash are both interpreted languages that interact directly with the OS through the shell, making them useful for automating tedious tasks as well as a choice tool for bad actors looking to quickly make changes within a system. By developing a better understanding of these tools, I can better understand the situations I may find myself in in the industry, and can begin to bring my ideas to fruition.

## Fundamental concepts learned in Ops 201

- We learned a great deal about how to properly secure both a Windows and Linux environment, in addition to what to look for to indicate the presence of malware, and other general best practices for cybersecurity. We practiced a great deal with fixing broken Windows systems, experimenting with a number of tools. In my extracurricular work, I did some practice with Kali Linux.

## Favorite Ops Challenge Assignment

- I really enjoyed Ops Challenge 6. While it wouldn't really be useful, as it simply performed the process of using the `touch` or `mkdir` command, but in a much more complicated way. Despite this, it was a fun puzzle to figure out, and required quite a bit of code relative to the other assignments, which really helped me to cement Bash syntax into my head. This one felt like a culmination of my practice in Bash, and was the first time I felt like I was beginning to understand how to make actually useful scripts based on this format.

## Applying shell scripting to the workplace

- Many of these scripts revolve around system automation, which is useful when configuring a new PC or a group of PCs to your desired settings. Most of the others were designed to look either inward or outward, either revealing details about an outside source on the internet, or documenting system status/settings to view necessary information quickly, which would be useful in any analyst/admin role. One was even designed to remove bloatware in addition to configuring system settings.

## Scripts to improve

- Definitely Ops Challenge 6, I would like to reformat it to perform a more useful function. I would also like to continue to refine my PowerShell scripts so that they truly can be used to configure computers to either be safer, run better, or just fit the settings I need for my devices.

## Improving shell scripting skillset

- All of it. I love Bash, and want to keep practicing with it, but I am looking forward to using Python. I want to continue to pursue PowerShell, so that I can write PowerShell scripts to both make my life and my future employer's life easier. And I want to continue my extracurricular pursuits, refining my skills with Kali Linux and AI.
